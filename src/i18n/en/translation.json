    "content": " ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Lucas Cruz, an enthusiastic Frontend Developer with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, acquired through a two-year degree in Technologies and Programming of Information Systems. Although I have not yet had formal work experience in the field, I completed a curricular internship as a QA Specialist in Atlanse.pt, where I developed a keen eye for detail and a strong understanding of software quality assurance principles. This experience has enriched my approach to frontend development, ensuring not only aesthetically pleasing but also functionally robust user interfaces. I have dedicated my time to building personal projects that showcase my ability to create attractive and responsive user interfaces. One of the projects I am most proud of is my band's official site (VoidWomb). I have a passion for interface design and user experience, and I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and methodologies to enhance my skills, like React and agile development. I am eager to contribute to a team that values innovation, quality, and continuous development, where I can learn, grow, and eventually lead projects that make a difference.",
